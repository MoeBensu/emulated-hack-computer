# Building-a-Hack-Computer
Based on the project-centered textbook "The Elements of Computing Systems" and using its supplied tools.

__On the whole project:__

The book specifies projects in the end of each chapter. The projects build on each others in order to build a modern computer from "zero" (a Hack computer). Each hardware is built using the tools supplied with the book (HardwareSimulator, Assembler, CPU-Emulator, .. etc - all found in the tools folder). The used hardware description language (DHL) is a special version built by the textbook instructors, the same goes for the tools. Also, the cmp files and test files of the built hardware are provided by them. 
All of the API material and tools can be found at their website: https://www.nand2tetris.org
